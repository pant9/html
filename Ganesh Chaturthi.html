<h1 class="solid"> 	Ganesh chaturthi, A festival of hope and prosperity.</h1>
<p>Ganesh Chaturthi, one of the most-loved festivals in India, is replete with divinity, celebrations, and flamboyance. It is a festival that cuts across all religions, castes, and creeds. Think Ganesh Chaturthi, and the beautiful idol of Lord Ganesh comes to mind - the excitement, the crowds, the aroma of His favourite modaks and chants just fill the air! Lord Ganesh is seen as a God for all. He is regarded as the God of new beginnings, fresh starts, remover of obstacles, and a patron of learning. This 10-day long festival not only celebrates the birthday of Lord Ganesh, but is also a social and community event that brings people together and promotes harmony. The popular belief is that Lord Ganesh visits earth during these 10 days to bless His devotees. Hence, for those who have an existing Ganesh statue in their house, this is the time to serve Him and take special care of Him, like a much-loved guest. Festivals in India are incomplete without a host of delicacies and Ganesh Chaturthi is no different. Throughout this 10-day extravaganza, a lot of effort is put in to please Lord Ganesh. His favourite food is prepared and offered to Him as bhog..</p>

<p>Although Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated traditionally in most states of India, the fervour with which it is celebrated in the state of Maharashtra is unparalleled. Interestingly, it was not a significant part of Maharashtra’s tradition until its advent here during the Maratha reign. In fact, Ganesh Chaturthi was initially just a homely affair. It was Bal Gangadhar Tilak (1856–1920), a noted leader of the Indian Independence Movement, who was instrumental in converting Lord Ganesh into a powerful cultural and religious symbol of unity for the Maharashtrian people in an attempt to resist the British rule. Though the British regime clamped down very heavily on political opposition and rebellion, they did not interfere with religious observances. Hence, the Ganesh festival provided a space to show national unity. In 1893, Tilak reinvented the Ganesh Chaturthi, converting it from an annual family celebration to a full-fledged public event.</p>

<h1>ॐ गजाननं भूंतागणाधि सेवितम्, कपित्थजम्बू फलचारु भक्षणम्
उमासुतम् शोक विनाश कारकम्, नमामि विघ्नेश्वर पादपंकजम्
भावार्थ- मैं विघ्नेश्वर के चरण कमलों को नमन करता हूं, जिनका चेहरा हाथी जैसा है, हमेशा भगवान, कैथ और जामुन के भूतों द्वारा सेवा की जाती है, जिनके लिए फल पसंदीदा भोजन है, पार्वती के पुत्र हैं, और जो संहारक हैं जीवों के दुखों से।</h1>
<h1 class="solid"> Origins of Ganesha</h1>
<p> The son of Shiva and Parvati, Ganesha has an elephantine countenance with a curved trunk and big ears atop the pot-bellied body of a four-armed man. He is the lord of success and the destroyer of evils and obstacles, worshiped as the god of education, wisdom, and wealth.
Ganesha is also known as Ganapati, Vinayaka, and Binayak. Worshippers also regard him as the destroyer of vanity, selfishness, and pride, the personification of the material universe in all its manifestations. </p>

<h1>Ganesha's Symbolism</h1>
<p>Ganesha's head symbolizes the Atman or the soul, which is the supreme reality of human existence, while his body signifies Maya or mankind's earthly existence. The elephantine head denotes wisdom and its trunk represents Om, the sound symbol of cosmic reality.

In his upper right hand, Ganesha holds a goad, which helps him propel mankind forward on the eternal path and remove obstacles from the way. The noose in Ganesha's upper left hand is a gentle implement to capture all difficulties. The broken tusk that Ganesha holds like a pen in his lower right hand is a symbol of sacrifice, which he broke for writing the Mahabharata, one of Sanskrit's two major texts. The rosary in his other hand suggests that the pursuit of knowledge should be continuous.

The laddoo or sweet he holds in his trunk represents the sweetness of the Atman. His fan-like ears convey that he will always hear the prayers of the faithful. The snake that runs round his waist represents energy in all forms. And he is humble enough to ride the lowest of creatures, a mouse.</p>
